Vienna Parnell's personal website

I coded this website from scratch using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and I continue to update the website regularly with more
updates to my resume and experience.

Not only is my personal website a dynamic, practical way of interacting with my content, but it's also a great for me to
improve my web development and UI/UX skills!

Thank you for stopping by, and don't hesitate to reach out to me with any inquiries.
