                            I'm also pursuing a minor in engineering management. I'm a well-rounded student with both technical and 
                            soft skills, and I'm excited to continue to develop and apply my abilities in different environments. </p>

                                I conducted research in deep learning for facial emotion recognition in the field of human-machine interaction through micro-expression detection. 
                                I coded using Python and OpenCV libraries to test my multi-layer network across four datasets: FER-2013, CASME-II, FERG, and SAMM.

                        <h2> The Vanderbilt Vanguard: Writer (2022 - present) </h2>
                
                        <p> I write monthly articles on topics in the realms of technology, entrpreneurship, and computer science.
                            The publication cycle involves several stages of drafts and revisions, including brainstorming with 
                            staff, meeting with editor, and receiving final approval from managing editor.

                        <p> I assist in the development and execution of marketing campaigns and initiatives for Pure Mentorship. 
                            I have designed a tri-fold brochure, various pamphlets for different target audiences (mentors, mentees, and interns), and the 
                            employee handbook.

                        <h2> Miniature Robotics: Origami-Inspired Ingestible Biomedical Robots (2021) </h2>
                
                        <p> In this project, I designed a 2in. x 2in. foldable "robot" that is swallowed by a 
                            patient who has accidentally ingested a button battery. This project both built on my 
                            enjoyment of the traditional art of origami and my interest in learning about its 
                            applications in engineering.
